BUILDING CONSTRUCTION

§ 18.07.070

a.

If a property owner does not intend to construct anything on the property following
demolition in the foreseeable future, the property owner shall file a declaration under
penalty of perjury to that effect, and the building official may issue the demolition permit
on the condition that the property where the demolition is to occur will be properly secured
and landscaped.

b.

If the city has ordered the demolition of the structure because it is an imminent danger to
public health or safety, the building official may issue the demolition permit on the
condition that the property where the demolition is to occur will be properly secured and
landscaped even though the property owner has not applied for any construction permits.

c.

If a property owner of a non-residential project:
1.

Has been granted all project approvals required under Title 25 of this code and under
the California Environmental Quality Act; and

2.

Produces evidence, to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director, that
special circumstances exist to warrant early demolition; and

3.

Produces evidence, to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director, that
he/she is preparing or is having prepared, plans for the project for which the
demolition is intended; and

4.

Declares under penalty of perjury that he/she will submit said plans together with a
building permit application for the project to the City's building division no later than
90 days after obtaining a demolition permit; then the Community Development
Director may authorize the Building Official to issue the demolition permit with
appropriate terms and conditions to ensure safety, security and cleanliness of the
property.
In the event the property owner fails to obtain a building permit for the project within
60 days of submitting a building permit application to the building division, pursuant
to item (c)(4), the property owner shall, within 30 days remove all debris from the
site, permanently secure the property and install landscaping to the satisfaction of
the Community Development Director. A decision to deny such a request for early
demolition may be appealed to the City Council within 10 calendar days of the date
of the Community Development Director's decision.

d.

If a building or structure is declared a public nuisance under Section 1.16.015, the
Community Development Director may issue a demolition permit for said structure on the
condition that the property where the demolition is to occur will be properly secured and
landscaped. The owner of a building or structure which currently is or may be subject to
enforcement proceedings under Section 1.16.015, but which has not been formally declared
a nuisance under that provision, may apply to the Community Development Director to
obtain a demolition permit for the structure. If granted, such permit shall be conditioned on
appropriate securing and landscaping of the property. The decision whether to grant or
deny a demolition permit under this subsection (d) shall rest within the discretion of the
Community Development Director in light of the conditions present on the property in
question.

Failure to complete the work within the time allowed, unless an extension of time has been
specifically approved by the building official, will cause the permit for such work to become
null and void. Failure to commence work on any permit within 12 months of issuance will cause
the permit for such work to become null and void. Abandonment of the work authorized by the
permit will also cause the permit to immediately become null and void. In each instance, a new
permit requiring compliance with all current codes and payment of all fees shall be required to
recommence work. The request for an extension of time must be submitted in writing prior to
the expiration of the time allowed.
The time limit allowed to complete the work and obtain a building final for any permit that
has been extended shall be 180 days from the date of the extension. Failure to complete the
work within the time allowed by a first permit extension will cause the permit for such work to
become null and void, unless a second extension has been specifically approved by the building
official. A new permit requiring compliance with all current codes and payment of all fees shall
be required to recommence work. Prior to expiration of a first extension of a building permit,
an owner may apply for a second extension. The request for a second extension of time must
be submitted in writing prior to the expiration of the time allowed under the first extension.
All extension requests shall be made in writing, and must demonstrate justifiable cause for the
extension.
Every permit extension issued by the Building Official under the provisions of the technical
codes shall expire by limitation and become null and void, if the building or work authorized
by such permit extension is not recommenced within 120 days from the date of such permit
extension, or if the building or work authorized by such permit extension is suspended or
abandoned at any time after the work is recommenced for a period of 120 days. The building
or work shall be considered suspended or abandoned if a substantial inspection has not been
conducted. The following are considered substantial inspections when all corrections have been
performed and that portion of the work has been signed off by a city inspector:

Plan review, permit, and inspection requirements. The Building Division shall provide an
administrative, nondiscretionary plan check review process to expedite approval of small
residential rooftop solar energy systems within 30 days of the adoption of the ordinance codified
in this section.
The Building Division shall process, review, and approve the application for the installation
or use of a solar system in the same manner as an application for review of an architectural
modification to the property, and shall not be willfully avoided or delayed.
If an application is deemed incomplete, a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies
in the application and any additional information or documentation required to be eligible for
expedited permit issuance shall be sent to the applicant for resubmission.
If an application for the installation of a solar system is not denied in writing within 45 days of
receipt of a complete application the application shall be deemed approved, unless the delay is
the result of a reasonable request for additional information.
The City of Burlingame Planning Division may require an applicant to apply for a use permit
if the Planning Division finds, based on substantial evidence, that the solar energy system
could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety. Such decisions may be
appealed to City of Burlingame Planning Commission.
Review of the permit application shall be limited to the Building Division's review of whether
the application meets local, state, and federal health and safety requirements. If a use permit
is required, the building official may deny an application for the use permit if the building
official makes written findings based upon substantive evidence in the record that the proposed
installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety and there is no
feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid, as defined, the adverse impact. Such findings
shall include the basis for the rejection of the potential feasible alternative for preventing
the adverse impact. Such decisions may be appealed to the City of Burlingame Planning
Commission. Any condition imposed on an application shall be designed to mitigate the
specific, adverse impact upon health and safety at the lowest possible cost.
A "feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact" includes,
but is not limited to, any cost-effective method, condition, or mitigation imposed by the City
of Burlingame on another similarly situated application in a prior successful application for a
permit. The City of Burlingame shall use its best efforts to ensure that the selected method,
condition, or mitigation meets the conditions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of
subdivision (d) of Section 714 of the Civil Code defining restrictions that do not significantly
increase the cost of the system or decrease its efficiency or specified performance.
The City of Burlingame shall not condition approval of an application for a small residential
rooftop solar energy system on the approval of an association, as defined in Section 4080 of the
Civil Code.
Only one inspection shall be required and performed by the Building Division for small
residential rooftop solar energy systems eligible for expedited review. During the required
inspection, if it is found that the installation does not conform to the approved plans and/or
comply with the current California Building Code requirements then an additional, follow-up
inspection shall be required.
If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is
authorized and required but need not conform to the requirements of this section.
A separate fire inspection may be performed by the Central County Fire Department, if required.
The inspection shall be done within three business days and may include consolidated
inspections.

vehicle supply equipment station that is designed and built in compliance with California
Code of Regulations, Title 24 Part 3 California Electrical Code Article 625, as it reads on
the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section or as it may be amended, and
delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into a plug-in electric vehicle.
"Specific, adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable
impact, based on objective, identified, and written public health or safety standards,
policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete.

C.

Applicability. This section applies to the permitting of all electric vehicle charging stations
in the city. Electric vehicle charging stations legally established or permitted prior to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this section are not subject to the requirements
of this section unless physical modifications or alterations are undertaken that materially
change the size, type, or components of a pre-existing charging station in such a way as to
require new permitting. Routine operation and maintenance shall not require a permit.

D.

Electric Vehicle Charging Station Requirements. All electric vehicle charging stations shall
meet applicable health and safety standards and requirements imposed by the state and the
city.
Electric vehicle charging stations shall meet all applicable safety and performance
standards established by the California Electrical Code, the Society of Automotive
Engineers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and accredited testing
laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories and, where applicable, rules of the Public
Utilities Commission and other applicable laws and regulations regarding safety and
reliability.

E.

Submittal Requirements. All documents required for the submission of an electric vehicle
charging station application shall be made available on the city's website. Electronic
submittal of the required permit application and documents by facsimile shall be made
available to all electric vehicle charging station permit applicants. Because the city does
not have an adopted electronic signature protocol as of the time of the adoption of the
ordinance codified in this section, an electronic signature cannot be accepted in lieu of a
wet signature on the application. However, as soon as the city adopts such a protocol,
electronic signatures will be accepted on charging station applications, and the city's
website and application materials will be updated accordingly.
The city's building division shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which the
electric vehicle charging stations shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The

electric vehicle permit process, standard(s), and checklist(s) may substantially conform
to recommendations for permitting, including the checklist and standards contained in
the "Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist" of the "Zero-Emission
Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook" published by the California
State Office of Planning and Research.
For purposes of calculating permit fees under the city's adopted master fee schedule, the
value to be used in computing the electric vehicle charging station permit and plan review
shall be the total value of all construction work for which the permit is issued as well as
any other equipment. The determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions
of this section shall be made by the building official.
F.

Plan Review, Permit, and Inspection Requirements. The building official shall implement
an administrative review process to expedite approval of electric vehicle charging stations.
Only permits or approvals that conform to all applicable provisions of this chapter and Title
18, including design review, shall be issued. The building official or designated staff
members shall make determinations of conformance. Where the application meets the
requirements of the approved checklist and standards and there are no specific, adverse
impacts upon public health or safety, the building division shall complete the building
permit approval process, which is nondiscretionary. Review of the application for electric
vehicle charging stations shall be limited to the building official's review of whether the
application meets local, state, and federal health and safety requirements.
The building official may require an applicant to apply for an "electric vehicle charging
station use permit" if the building official makes written findings that the proposed electric
vehicle charging stations could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and
safety. The building official's decision may be appealed to the city planning commission.
If an electric vehicle charging station use permit is required, the building official may only
deny an application for the electric vehicle charging station use permit if the official makes
written findings based upon substantial evidence in the record that the proposed installation
would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety and there is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact. Such findings shall include
the basis for the rejection of the potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse
impact. The building official's decision may be appealed to the city planning commission.
If the building official issues an electric vehicle charging station use permit, the permit may
include conditions designed to mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon health and safety
at the lowest possible cost.
A feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact includes,
but is not limited to, any cost-effective method, condition, or mitigation imposed by the
city on another similarly situated application in a prior successful application for a permit.

If an application is deemed incomplete, a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies
in the application and any additional information or documentation required to be eligible
for expedited permit issuance shall be sent to the applicant for resubmission. A separate
fire inspection may be performed by the Central County Fire Department, if required.

CHAPTER 18.18
RADIO AND TELEVISION ANTENNAS
§ 18.18.010. Purpose.
(a)

Satellite Antennas. Most homes in Burlingame are either built on flat lots or on hillsides.
The flat lots are typically of relatively small size with substantial lot coverage. Hillside
developments are visible from a wide area. Placement of satellite antennas can interfere
with views of streetscape, natural vegetation and scenery in both flat and hillside areas.
Therefore, in order to maintain the aesthetic objective of minimal intrusion into views of
neighborhood streetscape, existing landscaping, long distance views and other natural
effects, it is necessary that satellite antennas in residential zones be placed in the least
obtrusive location upon residential properties while still allowing access to satellite signals.
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish criteria for the location of satellite antennas
consistent with federal standards, as amended in March 1996.

(b)

Ham and CB Antennas. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish criteria for the
location, height and bulk of ham radio and CB antennas that will reasonably accommodate
amateur radio activities and create the minimum interference with those activities
consonant with promoting local safety and aesthetic interests.

(c)

Other Antennas. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish locational restrictions that
will mitigate the visual impact of other types of antennas.
(Ord. 1327 § 1, (1986); Ord. 1513 § 1, (1994); Ord. 1549 § 1, (1996))
§ 18.18.020. Definitions.
"Antenna" means any combination of wood, metal, wire or other substance, which either alone
or in combination with any supports, is erected or constructed for the purpose of receiving or
transmitting radio, television or any other electronic or other type of signal.
"Ham" or "CB antenna" is a radio receiving and transmitting antenna for amateur radio and
citizens band operation.
"Satellite antenna" is an antenna capable of receiving communications from a transmitter or
a transmitter relay located in planetary orbit. Satellite antennas are sometimes referred to as
"satellite earth station antennas," and "satellite dish antennas."

CHAPTER 18.22
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 18.22.010. Findings of fact.
(a)

The flood hazard areas of the city of Burlingame are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.

(b)

These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special
flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately
anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 1211 § 1, (1981); Ord. 1916 § 2, (2015); Ord. 2010 § 12, (2022))
§ 18.22.020. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and
to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(a)

Protect human life and health;

(b)

Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(c)

Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(d)

Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(e)

Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

(f)

Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas
of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(g)

Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;
and

(h)

Insure that those who occupy the area of special flood hazard assume responsibility for
their actions.

In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
(a)

Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to
water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood
heights or velocities;

(b)

Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be

CHAPTER 18.28
UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDING HAZARD REDUCTION PROGRAM
§ 18.28.010. Purpose.
It is found and declared in the event of a strong or moderate local earthquake, loss of life or
serious injury may result from damage or collapse of unreinforced masonry buildings in the city.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety by establishing a set of structural repair
standards to be used to strengthen unreinforced masonry buildings and require owners to make
their buildings conform to those standards within a reasonable period of time. The provisions
of this chapter are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to
reduce the risk of life loss or injury but will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or
prevent earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards. This
seismic hazard reduction program is consistent with CaliforniaHealth and Safety Code Sections
19160 through 19168 and Government Code Sections 8875 through 8878 et seq.
(Ord. 1419 § 1, (1990))
§ 18.28.020. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter the words and phrases set out in this section shall mean as follows.
"Bearing wall" means any wall supporting a floor or roof where the total superimposed load
exceeds 100 pounds per linear foot, or any unreinforced masonry wall supporting its own weight
when over six feet in height.
"Civil engineer" or "structural engineer" means a licensed civil or structural engineer registered
by the state pursuant to the rules and regulations of Title 16. Chapter 5 of the California
Administrative Code.
"Occupant load" means the total maximum number of occupants in the building determined
by either 1) Table 33-A of the Uniform Building Code or, 2) the actual maximum number of
occupants in the building as certified by the building owner and current tenants.
"Story" means that portion of a building included between the upper surface of any floor and
the upper surface of the floor next above, except that the topmost story shall be that portion of a
building included between the upper surface of the topmost floor and the ceiling or roof above.
"Unreinforced masonry building" means any building containing walls constructed wholly or
partially with any of the following materials and containing less than fifty percent of the
minimum area of reinforcing steel required by the 1985 Uniform Building Code Section 2407

§ 18.28.112. Section A107 amended—Materials of construction.
Section A107(b), (d) and (f) are amended to read as follows:
(b)

Existing Materials. 1. Unreinforced masonry walls. Unreinforced masonry walls analyzed
in accordance with this chapter may provide vertical support for roof and floor construction
and resistance to lateral loads.
All units of both bearing and non-bearing walls shall be laid with full shoved mortar joints;
all head, bed and wall (collar) joints shall be solidly filled with mortar; and the bonding of
adjacent wythes of multi-wythe walls shall be as follows:
The facing and backing shall be bonded so that not less than 4 percent of the wall surface of
each face is composed of headers extending not less than four inches into the backing. The
distance between adjacent fulllength headers shall not exceed 24 inches either vertically or
horizontally. In walls where a single header does not extend through the wall, headers from
the opposite sides shall overlap at least four inches, or headers from opposite sides shall be
covered with another header course overlapping the header below at least four inches.
Wythes of walls not bonded as described above shall be considered as veneer. The veneer
wythe shall not be included in the effective thickness used to calculate the height-tothickness ratio and the shear capacity of the wall.
Tension stresses due to seismic forces normal to the wall may be neglected if the wall
does not exceed the height-to-thickness ratio set forth in Table A1-F and the in-plane
shear stresses due to seismic loads set forth in Table A1-I. If the wall height-to-thickness
ratio exceeds the specified limit, the wall may be supported by vertical bracing members
designed to satisfy the requirements of the 1985 Uniform Building Code. The deflection of

Veneer. Veneer shall be anchored with
approved anchor ties, conforming to the
required design capacity specified in
Section 3304(c) of the 1985 Uniform
Building Code, and placed at a maximum
spacing of 24 inches.

Exception: Existing veneer anchor ties may be acceptable provided the ties are in good
condition and conform to the minimum size, maximum spacing and material requirements
as indicated below. The veneer anchor ties shall be corrugated galvanized iron strips not
less than one inch in width, eight inches in length and one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness
and shall be located and laid in every alternate course in the vertical height of the wall at a
spacing not to exceed 17 inches on center horizontally. As an alternate, the spacing may be
every fourth course vertically at a spacing not to exceed nine inches on center horizontally.
The existence and condition of existing veneer anchor ties shall be verified as follows:

(d)

1.

An approved testing laboratory shall verify the location and spacing of the ties and
shall submit a report to the Chief Building Inspector for approval as a part of the
structural analysis.

2.

The veneer in a selected area shall be removed to expose a representative sample of
ties (not less than four) for inspection by the Chief Building Inspector.

3.

Existing roof, floors, walls, footings, and wood framing. Existing materials, including
wood shear walls, may be used as a part of the lateral load resisting system, provided
that stresses in these materials do not exceed the values shown in Table No. A1-G.

Minimum Acceptable Quality of Existing Unreinforced Masonry Walls. 1. General
Provisions. All unreinforced masonry walls utilized to carry vertical loads and seismic
forces parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane shall be tested as specified in this
subsection. All masonry quality shall equal or exceed the minimum standards established
herein or shall be removed and replaced by new materials. The quality of mortar in all
masonry walls shall be determined by performing in-place shear tests. The vertical wall
joint between wythes (collar joint) shall be inspected at each test location after the in-place
shear tests, and an estimate of the percentage of wythe to wythe mortar coverage shall be
reported along with the results of the in-place shear tests. Where the exterior face is veneer,
the type of veneer, its thickness and its bonding and/or ties to the structural wall masonry
shall also be reported.
Nothing shall prevent the pointing with mortar of all the masonry wall joints before the
tests are first made. Prior to any pointing, the mortar joints must be raked and cleaned to
remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar for pointing shall be Type S or N except
masonry cements shall not be used. All preparation and mortar pointing shall be done under
the continuous inspection of a special inspector.
At the conclusion of the inspection, the inspector shall submit a written report to the person
responsible for the seismic analysis of the building setting forth the results of the work
inspected. Such report shall be submitted to the Chief Building Inspector for approval
as part of the structural analysis. All testing shall be performed in accordance with the
requirements specified in this section by an approved agency. An accurate record of all
such tests and their location in the building shall be recorded and these results shall be

submitted to the Chief Building Inspector for approval as part of the structural analysis.
2.

Number and location of tests. The minimum number of tests shall be as follows. At
each of both the first and top stories, not less than two per wall line or line of wall
elements providing a common line of resistance to lateral forces. At each of all other
stories, not less than one per wall element providing a common line of resistance to
lateral forces. In any case, not less than one per 1500 square feet of wall surface and
a total of eight.
The shear tests shall be taken at locations representative of the mortar conditions
throughout the entire building, taking into account variations in workmanship at
different building height levels, variations in weathering of the exterior surfaces, and
variations in the condition of the interior surfaces due to deterioration caused by
leaks and condensation of water and/or by the deleterious effects of other substances
contained within the building.
Where the higher h/t ratios allowed in footnotes 4 and 5 of Table A1-F are to be
utilized, all the in-place shear tests taken at the top story shall be included in the 80
percent of the shear tests used to determine the minimum mortar shear strength. The
exact test locations shall be determined at the building site by the person responsible
for the seismic analysis of the subject building.

3.

(f)

In-place shear tests. The bed joint of the outer wythe of the masonry wall shall be
tested by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the adjacent bricks in the wythe.
The head joint opposite the load end of the test brick shall be carefully excavated and
removed. The brick adjacent to the loaded end of the test brick shall be carefully
removed by sawing or drilling and excavating to provide space for a hydraulic ram
and steel loading blocks. Steel blocks the size of the end of the bricks shall be used
on each end of the ram and shall not contact the bed joints. The load shall be applied
horizontally in the plane of the wythe until either a crack can be seen or a slip occurs.
The strength of the mortar shall be calculated by dividing the load at the time of the
first crack or movement by the nominal gross area of the sum of the two bed joints.

Determination of Allowable Stresses for Design Methods Based on Test Results. 1. Design
shear values. Design seismic in-plane shear stresses shall be substantiated by tests
performed as specified in Item No. 3 of Subsection (d). The minimum quality mortar in 80
percent of the tests shall not be less than the total of 30 psi when reduced to an equivalent
zero axial stress.

Design stresses shall be related to test results obtained in accordance with Table No. A1-I.
Intermediate values between 5 and 10 psi may be interpolated.

equivalent at a maximum anchor spacing of six feet.
All unreinforced masonry walls shall be anchored at all floors and ceiling with tension
bolts through the wall or by existing rod anchors at a maximum anchor spacing of
six feet. All existing rod anchors shall be secured to the joists to develop the required
forces. Tests conforming to this chapter will be required to verify the adequacy of the
embedded ends of existing rod anchors.
Exception: Walls need not be anchored to ceiling systems that, because of their low
mass and or relative location with respect to the floor or roof systems, would not
impose significant normal forces on the wall and cause out-of-plane wall failure.
Calculations and drawings to verify this exception must be submitted as part of the
analysis.
At the roof and all floor levels, the anchors nearest the building corners shall be
combination shear and tension anchors located not more than two feet horizontally
from the inside corners of the walls.
When access to the exterior face of the masonry wall is prevented by proximity of an
existing building, wall anchors conforming to Items 5 (a) or (b) in Table No. A1-H
may be used.
Alternative devices to be used in lieu of tension bolts for masonry wall anchorage
shall be tested as specified in Section A107(h).
2.

Diaphragm chord stresses of horizontal diaphragms shall be developed in existing
materials or by the addition of new materials.

3.

Where trusses and beams other than rafters or joists are supported on masonry
independent secondary columns shall be installed to support vertical loads.

4.

Parts and exterior wall appendages not capable of resisting the forces specified in this
chapter shall be removed, stabilized, or braced to ensure that the parapets and
appendages remain in their original position. The maximum height of an unbraced,
unreinforced masonry parapet above the lower of either the level of tension anchors
or roof sheathing, shall not exceed one and one-half times the thickness of the parapet
wall. If the required parapet height exceeds this maximum height a bracing system
designed for the force factors specified in the Table 23-J of the 1985 Uniform
Building Code shall support the top of the parapet. Parapet corrective work must be
performed in conjunction with the installation of tension roof anchors.
The minimum height of a parapet above the wall anchor shall be 12 inches.
Exception: If a reinforced concrete beam is provided at the top of the wall, the
minimum height above the wall anchor may be six inches.

5.

All deteriorated mortar joints in unreinforced masonry walls shall be pointed with
Type S or N mortar. Prior to any pointing, the wall surface must be raked and cleaned
to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. All preparation and pointing shall be done
under the continuous inspection of a special inspector. At the conclusion of the
project, the inspector shall submit a written report to the Chief Building Inspector
setting forth the portion of work inspected.

Design Check for Compatibility of Roof Diaphragm Stiffness to Unreinforced Masonry Wall
Out-of-Plane Stability.
Sec. A109
(a)

General. The requirements of this section are in addition to the other analysis requirements
of this Chapter. The relative stiffness and strength of a diaphragm governs the amount of
amplification of the seismic ground motion by the diaphragm, and therefore, a diaphragm
stiffness and strength related check of the out-of-plane stability of unreinforced masonry
walls anchored to wood diaphragms shall be made. This section contains a procedure for
evaluation of the out-of-plane stability of unreinforced masonry walls anchored to wood
diaphragms that are coupled to shear resisting elements.

consideration.
Demand Capacity Ratio (DCR). A ratio of the following:

(c)

1.

Demand equals the lateral forces due to 33 percent of the combined weight of the
diaphragm and the tributary weight of the wall and other elements anchored to the
diaphragm.

2.

Capacity equals the diaphragm total shear strength in the direction under
consideration as determined using the values in Tables No. A1-J or Table A1-K.

Notations.
D = depth of diaphragm, in feet, measured perpendicular to the diaphragm span.
h/t = height-to-thickness of an unreinforced masonry wall. The height shall be measured
between wall anchorage levels and the thickness shall be measured through the wall cross
section at the level under consideration.
L = span of diaphragm between masonry shear walls or steel frames.
Vc = total shear capacity of cross walls in the direction of analysis immediately below the
diaphragm level being investigated as determined by using Tables No. A1-J and A1-K.
vu = maximum shear strength in pounds per foot for a diaphragm sheathed with any of the
materials given in Tables No. A1-J or A1-K.
Wd = total dead load of the diaphragm plus the tributary weight of the walls anchored to the
diaphragm, the tributary ceiling and partitions and weight of any other permanent building
elements at the diaphragm level under consideration.

(d)

Design Check Procedure.
1.

General. The demand capacity ratio (DCR) for the building shall be calculated using
the following equations:
DCR = 0.33 Wd / 2vu D For building without cross walls or
DCR = 0.33 Wd / 2vu D + Vc For building with cross walls

2.

Diaphragm Deflection. The calculated DCR shall be to the left of the curve in Figure
No. A1-L. Where the calculated DCR is outside (to the right of) the curve, the
diaphragm deflection limits are exceeded and cross walls may be used to reduce the
deflection.

3.

Unreinforced Masonry Wall Out-of-Plane Stability. The DCR shall be calculated
discounting any cross wall. If the DCR from this method corresponding to the
diaphragm span is to the right of the curve in Figure No. A1-L, the region within the
curve at and below the intersection of the diaphragm span with the curve may be used
to determine the allowable h/t values per Table No. A1-F.
