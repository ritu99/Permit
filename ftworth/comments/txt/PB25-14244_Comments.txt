**Interpretation: This section of the ordinance is not being enforced due to HB 2439 and
will only be considered as part of the project’s compliance to meet economic incentive
requirements in the NEZ or similar programs



(2) Garages A two-car garage is required. Garages facing the street shall be located at or
behind the front wall and shall not project in front of the front wall. All the required parking
spaces above two shall be behind the front wall.

**Interpretation: Section 6.507(c) of the zoning ordinance allows garages that face a public
or private street to project no greater than eight feet in front of the front wall of the house in
all single-family districts.

***Thus, I will allow garages to project no more than 8 feet in front of the front wall of the
house to reduce the conflict with 6.507 c’s established protections on “snout homes”

(Provided – Garage is flushed with the front wall of entry and bedroom 4

(Provided – Provided porch


b. Open porches can extend up to ten feet into the minimum front yard to encourage larger
porches. If a porch is provided, it shall be a minimum of six feet in depth.

**Interpretation: when a porch extends up to ten feet into the minimum front yard to
encourage larger porches, it must be a minimum of six feet in depth. Otherwise, a porch
that is less than six feet in depth is some sort of covered walkway entry feature.

(Provided – Porch extends 6’ from front wall and is wider than the six feet in depth


c. Homes shall have a minimum of one eight square foot window on all sides of the house.
The front wall shall have a minimum total window area of 16 square feet.


**Interpretation: To clarify this intent, elevations that are visible from the ROW shall have a
minimum of one eight square foot window on all sides of the house, not intended to
required windows on garage elevations.

(Provided – Compliant / showing sufficient square footage on elevations

If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.
