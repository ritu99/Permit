1. 12/4/2025 – CORRECTIONS REQUIRED – URBAN FORESTRY – INFILL TREES

   Please revise the site plan to show (two) three-foot caliper trees for each lot/unit.

   Currently there is showing only one tree for each lot in the front yard area. You do not have to
   plant one in the street Parkway, but if you choose to, you will need to contact the city forester
   office to obtain approval.
   Otherwise, please revise the site plan to show a minimum of 40% canopy cover per lot must be
   achieved in accordance with § 6.302.

   Per the 6.302(1)(d) URBAN FORESTRY.

   (1) One- and two-family residential land uses.
       a. Minimum retained or planted canopy coverage shall be 40%.

   (d) Infill house. An infill house shall be required to have one minimum three-inch caliper front
   yard tree of choice, and one minimum three-foot caliper street parkway tree as approved by the
