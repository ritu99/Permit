**Interpretation: This section of the ordinance is not being enforced due to HB 2439 and
will only be considered as part of the project’s compliance to meet economic incentive
requirements in the NEZ or similar programs



(2) Garages A two-car garage is required. Garages facing the street shall be located at or
behind the front wall and shall not project in front of the front wall. All the required parking
spaces above two shall be behind the front wall.

**Interpretation: Section 6.507(c) of the zoning ordinance allows garages that face a public
or private street to project no greater than eight feet in front of the front wall of the house in
all single-family districts.

***Thus, I will allow garages to project no more than 8 feet in front of the front wall of the
house to reduce the conflict with 6.507 c’s established protections on “snout homes”

(Provided – Front porch with posts is the main wall. Garage does not project further than 8’
from the front of the porch.


(3) Building design, architectural features.

b. Homes shall have an entry feature such as a porch or stoop that faces the street.

(Provided – front porch


c. Open porches can extend up to ten feet into the minimum front yard to encourage larger
porches. If a porch is provided, it shall be a minimum of six feet in depth.

**Interpretation: when a porch extends up to ten feet into the minimum front yard to
encourage larger porches, it must be a minimum of six feet in depth. Otherwise, a porch
that is less than six feet in depth is some sort of covered walkway entry feature.

(Provided – Porch is 6’ in depth


d. Homes shall have a minimum of one eight square foot window on all sides of the house.
The front wall shall have a minimum total window area of 16 square feet.


**Interpretation: To clarify this intent, elevations that are visible from the ROW shall have a
minimum of one eight square foot window on all sides of the house, not intended to
required windows on garage elevations.

(Provided – Compliant
