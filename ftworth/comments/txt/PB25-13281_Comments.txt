    If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
    email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
    determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
    mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
    rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
    is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
    Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
    Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
    cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
    profile.

    Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
    alley paving if it is to be used as access.

    A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
    currently existing.
