   Per ordinance § 6.507 ONE-FAMILY DWELLING UNIT DESIGN STANDARDS.
     One-family dwellings must comply with the following standards.
   (a) Elevation. The intent of this subsection is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
   the City of Fort Worth and its citizens through the adoption and enforcement of one-family dwelling
   unit design standards that limit the effects of repetition and uniformity by requiring substantive
   variation and diversity in front elevations within a certain lot pattern. The elevations for one-family
   dwelling units within a six (6) lot pattern must be sufficiently differentiated from each other and
   from any one-family dwelling unit that is two (2) lots removed on either side of the subject property


   Please upload with your revised, complete plan set, the missing monotony form and diagram to
   complete the review. If this is not a custom house, a monotony checklist with the elevations for
   each address/house that the subject house is compared to in the 6-lot pattern needs to be
   provided to verify this requirement will be met. See below link for residential submittal checklist on
   monotony for further instruction.

email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.
