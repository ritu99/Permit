1. SUBMISSION FORMAT FOR REVISIONS: To address plan review deficiencies, applicants must
   resubmit a complete set of plans in PDF format through the ACA portal. A partial submittal of
   individual sheets is not permitted and will delay the review process. A complete set is required to
   ensure that both the field drawing set and the City's record set remain current and identical
   throughout the process. Resubmittals, if necessary, must be submitted in the same format (PDF)
   and scale as the original submission. All revisions shall be clouded and detailed with an
   explanation from the professional in a response letter which addresses all holds identified by the
   plan’s examiner.
2. CORRECTIONS REQUIRE - SUBMISSION FOR REVISIONS
   A correction should not be submitted at this time. Corrections can only be submitted once the
   permit is in “Awaiting Client Reply” status. This permit is in plan review status. Once the permit
   status is in awaiting client reply, only then should corrections be uploaded. Please be sure that
   you upload with the category “Plan Revision” so the system routes the permit for review to the
   building plans examiner for routing. If done incorrectly the building reviewer is not aware that the
   permit needs to be routed. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
