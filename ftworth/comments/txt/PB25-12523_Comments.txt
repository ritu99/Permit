spaces above two shall be behind the front wall.

**Interpretation: Section 6.507(c) of the zoning ordinance allows garages that face a public
or private street to project no greater than eight feet in front of the front wall of the house in
all single-family districts.

***Thus, I will allow garages to project no more than 8 feet in front of the front wall of the
house to reduce the conflict with 6.507 c’s established protections on “snout homes”

(3) Building design, architectural features.

a. Homes shall have an entry feature such as a porch or stoop that faces the street. -
Provided – Porch facing street

b. Open porches can extend up to ten feet into the minimum front yard to encourage larger
porches. If a porch is provided, it shall be a minimum of six feet in depth.

**Interpretation: when a porch extends up to ten feet into the minimum front yard to
encourage larger porches, it must be a minimum of six feet in depth. Otherwise, a porch
that is less than six feet in depth is some sort of covered walkway entry feature.

(Provided – 6 feet from front door to wood post of porch

c. Homes shall have a minimum of one eight square foot window on all sides of the house.
The front wall shall have a minimum total window area of 16 square feet.

**Interpretation: To clarify this intent, elevations that are visible from the ROW shall have a
minimum of one eight square foot window on all sides of the house, not intended to
required windows on garage elevations. - Provided – Front shows 51 sf / provides 16 sf to
24 sf. of windows on all elevations

d. Front doors shall face the public street and shall be visible from the public street. Front
door openings shall not be recessed more than six feet from the front wall of the home. -
Provided – Front door is facing the front street and projects 6 feet from the front porch
posts

(4) Landscaping. Landscaping shall be kept to allow visibility to and from street-facing

    The location of ingress and egress driveways shall be subject to approval of the city traffic
    engineer under curb cut or laid-down curb permit procedures. Driveways shall not exceed
    sixty-five (65) per cent of the property frontage. There shall be a minimum of twenty (20)
    feet of curb along the street between driveways where there is more than one driveway on
    property under unified ownership or control and used as one premise. The decision of the
    city traffic engineer may be appealed to the city council.

    If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
    email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
    determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
    mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
    rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
    is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
    Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
    Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
    cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
    profile.

    A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
    currently existing.
