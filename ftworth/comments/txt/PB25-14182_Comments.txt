one-family dwelling unit design standards that limit the effects of repetition and uniformity
by requiring substantive variation and diversity in front elevations within a certain lot
pattern. The elevations for one-family dwelling units within a six (6) lot pattern must be
sufficiently differentiated from each other and from any one-family dwelling unit that is two
(2) lots removed on either side of the subject property on the same side of the street, as
generally depicted below and otherwise set forth herein.

If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.
