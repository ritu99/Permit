1. 12/11/2025 - INCOMPLETE - Although site plan and foundation are revised to not show a patio
   cover the roof plan, elevations, electrical, and framing still show there to be a covered patio.
   Regardless of the flatwork by others, this area will still count towards lot coverage.

   11/21/2025 - INCOMPLETE - Revised plan shows a "Texas covered patio" but a foundation plan
   stating that the patio flatwork by others. The covered portion will still count against lot coverage.

   LOT COVERAGE. The total lot area covered by the foundation of the main structure, attached and
   detached garages, carports, porte cocheres, accessory detached habitable areas, porches, patios
   and entry areas compared to the total site area. Any portion of the foundation not covered by roof
   is not considered in lot area calculations. Sheds, arbors, cantilevered (unsupported) upper story
   areas, eave overhangs and uncovered patios are not considered in lot coverage calculations.

   Please revise plans or provide approved variance letter.
   Please upload an updated and complete set of plans. Future holds may still apply.

   11/14/2025 - INCOMPLETE - Foundation plan shows foundation to be 3743sf, 143sf over the
   maximum allowed without a variance for A-5 zoning.

   10/29/2025 - CORRECTIONS REQUIRED - Lot Coverage
   A-5 zoning has a maximum 50% lot coverage; the proposed home has exceeded the 50%.
   Zoning summary page has the total coverage at 3529sf for 49%, but the foundation page shows
   the foundation to be 3743sf. At 3743sf for a 7200sf lot that bring the lot coverage to 51.97%.
   Please revise the proposed home to fit at or below the 50% or file for a variance with the BOA to
   continue this plan.

   Please upload an updated and complete set of plans. Future holds may still apply.
