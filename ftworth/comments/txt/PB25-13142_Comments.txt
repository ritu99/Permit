1. 11/18/2025- Continued hold
   11/11/2025- Continued hold- Missing the 3rd element to differentiate the duplex at 8005 Doreen.
   8009 Doreen has the following elements: exterior material and windows. Please refer to the
   monotony checklist at the link below to select an element that can be added to the facade. Each
   element can only be used once.
   10/31/2025-continued hold- There are only 2 elements shown that differentiate between this home
   and duplex at 8005 Doreen (exterior material, windows, ?) Please revise the elevation to have 3
   elements from the monotony list linked below. Please be advised that the diagram shows that this
   address has brick but the elevation with the plan set does not match that.

  10/21/2025- Continued Hold – The diagram provided does not have the addresses labeled on the
  pictures of the houses in the lot pattern. Also, the new duplex at 8005 Doreen is not on the
  diagram. Please revise.
  9/26/2025 – Corrections Required – Incomplete Monotony Checklist & Diagram
  Per ordinance 6.507 (a) Elevation. The intent of this subsection is to promote the health, safety,
  and general welfare of the City of Fort Worth and its citizens through the adoption and
  enforcement of one-family dwelling unit design standards that limit the effects of repetition and
  uniformity by requiring substantive variation and diversity in front elevations within a certain lot
  pattern. The elevations for one-family dwelling units within a six (6) lot pattern must be sufficiently
  differentiated from each other and from any one-family dwelling unit that is two (2) lots removed
  on either side of the subject property on the same side of the street, as generally depicted below
  and otherwise set forth herein.

  This submittal is missing the monotony diagram of the lot pattern with the subject house and the
  existing houses across the street and proposed duplex next door. To be able to verify that all
  elevations are differentiated from each other, the diagram needs to include the houses of the lots
  across the street (8020 & 8024 Doreen) and the new duplex next to this one at 8005 Doreen.
  Accela shows you are the applicant for that duplex which no longer makes this a custom house,
  and you must show that the duplexes have 3 differences. Please provide the complete monotony
  diagram to continue the review. See the new construction submittal checklist at the link below for
  more information. *Additional holds may apply. Reminder all revised files need to be uploaded as
  one complete plan set.

    If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
    email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
    determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
    mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
    rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
    is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
    Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
    Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
    cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
    profile.

    Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
    alley paving if it is to be used as access.

    A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
    currently existing.
