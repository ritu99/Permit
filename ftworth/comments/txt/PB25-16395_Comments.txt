3. 12/10/25 - CORRECTIONS REQUIRED - Extension required for water service install.


  There are two (2) options for service installation

  Opt A - Miscellaneous project – All requests are subject to a preliminary review to determine if
  water service can be installed by miscellaneous project.
  A miscellaneous project is the Water Department’s in-house design option for developer’s /
  customers to use for small extensions, fire line taps, water taps larger than 2 inches and as
  required by the City due to unusual circumstances.

  To receive an estimate you must first apply for a miscellaneous projects online at,
  https://aaapps.fortworthtexas.gov/CitizenAccess under the WATER tab. You must register for a
  log in to submit your request.

  Opt B – Community Facility Agreement
  The alternative option to city miscellaneous projects is to have water and/or sewer extended under
  a Community Facility Agreement (CFA).
  A CFA is a contract between a Developer and the City for the construction of Community
  Facilities, on the property in which the City has or will have an ownership or other legal interest,
  that the City requires to be constructed as a condition of plat or plan approval, or the issuance of a
  building permit.
  You can visit our website for more information regarding Community Facilities Agreement (CFA)
  and Infrastructure Plan Review (IPRC) which go hand in hand when you as the builder/developer
  request to have your utility contractor construct the infrastructure.

one-family dwelling unit design standards that limit the effects of repetition and uniformity
by requiring substantive variation and diversity in front elevations within a certain lot
pattern. The elevations for one-family dwelling units within a six (6) lot pattern must be
sufficiently differentiated from each other and from any one-family dwelling unit that is two
(2) lots removed on either side of the subject property on the same side of the street, as
generally depicted below and otherwise set forth herein.

greater than eight feet in front of the front wall of the house in all single-family districts.

located behind the rear wall of the house may be reduced to three feet. The side yard of

If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.
