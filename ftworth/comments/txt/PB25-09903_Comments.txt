      Comment 1. “Please provide the wall bracing plan conform to bracing methods per 2021
      International Residential Code Table R602.10.4”
      Scott,
      We had a similar comment for Phase 1 of this project. We have incorporated the required
      revisions from Phase 1 into Phase 2.

      Our structural engineer’s response is as follows:

      “This structure was designed using the 2021 IBC, the 2018 NDS, and the 2015 SDPWS
      due to the non- prescriptive conditions of this site. As such, the methods listed in 2021 IRC
      Section R602.10 are not

    applicable. Our approach is similar to CS-WSP but includes hold-downs. Shear wall tags
    and hold-down tags are provided on the plans. On S1.20, we provide schedules for the
    various shear wall and hold-down types.”

    Please let us know if any additional clarification is needed we can hope on a call my cell is
    817-966-9823.



    Comment 2. ”A0.01 You have VB listed as the construction type. In the list you reference
    Table 601 which is in the 2021 International Business Code (2021 IBC). Please change
    the construction type to VA and make sure all of the plans reflect VA construction and
    reference the 2021 IBC as well”

    Marilyn,
    Based on our review of the 2021 IRC and 2021 IBC, Type VB construction is allowable for
    this project.

     The project qualifies as townhomes that fall under IRC definitions for one- and two-family
    dwellings (up to three stories).
     Per IBC Table 601 (2021 IBC), Type VB construction is permitted for buildings of this size
    and occupancy, meeting all height, area, and fire-resistance requirements.
     The building design has been reviewed to comply with the 2021 IRC, the 2021 IBC, and
    applicable fire-resistance requirements. All provisions for exterior walls, structural framing,
    and fire protection are met.
    Please let us know if any additional clarification is needed we can hope on a call my cell is
    817-966-9823.
