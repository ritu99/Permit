       1. 1.6.6.H Entrances facing a pedestrian way shall incorporate elements that protect
       pedestrians from the sun and rain.

       2. 1.6.6.G. Primary pedestrian building entrances shall be located on the street frontage of
       the building. If a site’s slope presents significant impediments to a street fronting entrance,
       such as a need for stairs within the public right-of-way - and a proposed entrance from an
       adjacent side facade would provide a similarly visible and inviting entrance, City staff may
       approve an exception administratively. For buildings fronting other public spaces, the
       primary pedestrian entrance shall be oriented to and accessible from the public space.


       3. 1.6.5 Maximum height is 3 Stories
