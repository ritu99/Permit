No. of bedrooms: 3

Parking spaces required: 2

Parking spaces provided: 2


Additional Comments:

6.507.2 (c) ONE-FAMILY DWELLING UNIT DESIGN STANDARDS.

One-family dwellings must comply with the following standards.

Parking. Section 4.705.D.2 Single Family Home: (2) Parking. Two spaces located behind
the front building wall for dwelling units with three or fewer bedrooms, plus one space
located behind the front building wall or in the driveway for each bedroom above three.
Required parking spaces must be hard surface and dust free (asphalt or concrete). All
maneuvering space must be located off of the public right of way.


(a) Elevation. The intent of this subsection is to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of the City of Fort Worth and its citizens through the adoption and enforcement of
one-family dwelling unit design standards that limit the effects of repetition and uniformity
by requiring substantive variation and diversity in front elevations within a certain lot
pattern. The elevations for one-family dwelling units within a six (6) lot pattern must be
sufficiently differentiated from each other and from any one-family dwelling unit that is two
(2) lots removed on either side of the subject property on the same side of the street, as
generally depicted below and otherwise set forth herein.

(c) Attached garages. No attached garage facing a public or private street may project
greater than eight feet in front of the front wall of the house in all single-family districts.

(7) Garage/carport. No more than one garage and one carport or porte cochere shall be
allowed per residential unit on a single residential lot, unless the additional garages or
porte cocheres are an integral part of the main residential structure with the same roofline
and driveway as the residential structure.

(8) Side and rear yard setbacks. The side and rear yard setback for detached garages
located behind the rear wall of the house may be reduced to three feet. The side yard of
an attached garage may be located within three feet of the property line when located a
minimum of 18 feet back of the front wall of the house.

6.302(1) URBAN FORESTRY.

(1) One- and two-family residential land uses.
    a. Minimum retained or planted canopy coverage shall be 40%.

(d) Infill house. An infill house shall be required to have one minimum three-inch caliper
front yard tree of choice, and one minimum three-foot caliper street parkway tree as

approved by the city forester. In all instances, a minimum of 40% canopy cover per lot
must be achieved in accordance with § 6.302.


Sec. 22-176. Curb cuts and laid-down curb permit procedures.
The location of ingress and egress driveways shall be subject to approval of the city traffic
engineer under curb cut or laid-down curb permit procedures. Driveways shall not exceed
sixty-five (65) per cent of the property frontage. There shall be a minimum of twenty (20)
feet of curb along the street between driveways where there is more than one driveway on
property under unified ownership or control and used as one premise. The decision of the
city traffic engineer may be appealed to the city council.


If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.
