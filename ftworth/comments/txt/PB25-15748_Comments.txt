One-family dwellings must comply with the following standards.

Parking. Section 4.705.D.2 Single Family Home: (2) Parking. Two spaces located behind
the front building wall for dwelling units with three or fewer bedrooms, plus one space
located behind the front building wall or in the driveway for each bedroom above three.
Required parking spaces must be hard surface and dust free (asphalt or concrete). All

      c. The setback of the nearest building on either side that is the closest to the street,
up to a maximum setback of 50 feet, provided that said setback is not the result of a
variance granted by the board of adjustment. This requirement is applicable only if homes
have been constructed on at least 40% of the lots within the blockface.

***This requirement does not apply to properties within a cul-de-sac.



(a) Elevation. The intent of this subsection is to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of the City of Fort Worth and its citizens through the adoption and enforcement of
one-family dwelling unit design standards that limit the effects of repetition and uniformity
by requiring substantive variation and diversity in front elevations within a certain lot
pattern. The elevations for one-family dwelling units within a six (6) lot pattern must be
sufficiently differentiated from each other and from any one-family dwelling unit that is two
(2) lots removed on either side of the subject property on the same side of the street, as
generally depicted below and otherwise set forth herein.

(c) Attached garages. No attached garage facing a public or private street may project
greater than eight feet in front of the front wall of the house in all single-family districts.

(7) Garage/carport. No more than one garage and one carport or porte cochere shall be

allowed per residential unit on a single residential lot, unless the additional garages or
porte cocheres are an integral part of the main residential structure with the same roofline
and driveway as the residential structure.

(8) Side and rear yard setbacks. The side and rear yard setback for detached garages
located behind the rear wall of the house may be reduced to three feet. The side yard of
an attached garage may be located within three feet of the property line when located a
minimum of 18 feet back of the front wall of the house.

(1) One- and two-family residential land uses.
    a. Minimum retained or planted canopy coverage shall be 40%.
