2. 11/12/25 - CORRECTIONS REQUIRED - WATER AND SEWER MAINS DO NOT FRONT LOT -
   Extend Water main (At customers expense). There are two (2) options for extending public mains
   and services

  Opt A - Miscellaneous project – (WMP) All requests are subject to a preliminary review to
  determine if water/sewer main can be extended under a miscellaneous project.
  A miscellaneous project is the Water Department’s in-house design option for developer’s /
  customers to use for small extensions, fire line taps, water taps larger than 2 inches and as
  required by the City due to unusual circumstances. **A water and sewer misc. project must have
  separate WMP permit numbers.** Returned water/sewer WMP design must match building plan
  design to avoid further delay and WMP cost must be paid prior to Water Applications BUILDING
  permit approval.

  See attached handout detailing what you must provide to apply for a miscellaneous project.
  Miscellaneous projects can be applied online at, https://aaapps.fortworthtexas.gov/CitizenAccess
  under the WATER tab. You must register for a log in to submit your request.

  Opt B – Community Facility Agreement - (CFA) The alternative option to city miscellaneous
  projects is to have water and/or sewer extended under a Community Facility Agreement (CFA).
  A CFA is a contract between a Developer and the City for the construction of Community
  Facilities, on the property in which the City has or will have an ownership or other legal interest
  that the City requires to be constructed as a condition of plat or plan approval, or the issuance of a
  building permit.
  You can visit our website for more information regarding Community Facilities Agreement (CFA)
  and Infrastructure Plan Review (IPRC) which go hand in hand when you as the builder/developer
  request to have your utility contractor construct the infrastructure. Provide CFA #, IPRC #, CPN #
  for the installation of the services. Fees will not be collected until CFA is executed, and IPRC has
  been fully accepted.

If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.
