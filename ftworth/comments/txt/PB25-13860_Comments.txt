  3 WATER APPLICATIONS - ***** PLEASE READ *****
    3512 Ramona Dr
    WATER SERVICE - The existing water service is OUTSIDE the driveway. IF the driveway
    is enlarged and causes the water meter to be within the driveway, it will be required for the
    existing tap to be killed and a new one installed outside the driveway at the property owner
    / builder expense.
    SEWER SERVICE - Per the plumbing plan, the builder is aware of the existing sewer
    location. However if it is determined the sewer service used for this lot is outside of lot 19,
    a new sewer tap will be required within lot 19 frontage at owner / builder expense.

    *** IMPORTANT*** PLEASE READ WATER AND SEWER SERVICE LOCATION
