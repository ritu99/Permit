Forestry, § 6.300.
    (5) Access through residential districts. See Chapter 6, Development Standards, §
6.500 Access through Residential Districts.
    (6) Reconstruction of nonconforming accessory buildings. A nonconforming
accessory building that is damaged by fire, the elements or other cause beyond the control
of the owner may be repaired or reconstructed in the same rear and side yard setbacks
provided the construction is limited to the identical footprint (replacement of the foundation
is allowed); the building is the same design, height and roof pitch (use of different material
is allowed) and the owner or an agent obtains a building permit to repair the structure
within six months after the damage date. The owner shall have the burden of proof to
establish the damage date.
    (7) Garage/carport. No more than one garage and one carport or porte cochere shall

Sec. 22-176. Curb cuts and laid-down curb permit procedures.
The location of ingress and egress driveways shall be subject to approval of the city traffic
engineer under curb cut or laid-down curb permit procedures. Driveways shall not exceed
sixty-five (65) per cent of the property frontage. There shall be a minimum of twenty (20)
feet of curb along the street between driveways where there is more than one driveway on
property under unified ownership or control and used as one premise. The decision of the
city traffic engineer may be appealed to the city council.


If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving if it is to be used as access.

A parkway permit is required for all new construction projects for sidewalk(s), if not
currently existing.

  3 Water Applications

    Opt A - Miscellaneous project – All requests are subject to a preliminary review to
    determine if water/sewer main can be extended under a miscellaneous project.
    A miscellaneous project is the Water Department’s in-house design option for developer’s
    / customers to use for small extensions, fire line taps, water taps larger than 2 inches and
    as required by the City due to unusual circumstances.
    See attached handout detailing what you must provide to apply for a miscellaneous
    project.
    Miscellaneous projects can be applied online at, Accela Citizen Access under the WATER
    tab. You must register for a log in to submit your request.

    Opt B – Community Facility Agreement
    The alternative option to city miscellaneous projects is to have water and/or sewer
    extended under a Community Facility Agreement (CFA).
    A CFA is a contract between a Developer and the City for the construction of Community
    Facilities, on the property in which the City has or will have an ownership or other legal
    interest, that the City requires to be constructed as a condition of plat or plan approval, or
    the issuance of a building permit.
    You can visit our website for more information regarding Community Facilities Agreement
    (CFA) and Infrastructure Plan Review (IPRC) which go hand in hand when you as the
    builder/developer request to have your utility contractor construct the infrastructure.
