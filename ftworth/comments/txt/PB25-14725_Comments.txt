Additional Comments:

Dumpsters and mechanical equipment must be screened from view of the public right of
way. Zoning Ordinance 6.301D.

“No person shall remove any tree equal to or greater than six inches (6") in diameter or
greater size without a permit from Urban Forestry. Urban Forestry can be reached at (817)
392-7931. Failure to obtain a Tree Permit prior to tree removal could result in both civil
and criminal penalties."

Sec. 22-176. Curb cuts and laid-down curb permit procedures.
The location of ingress and egress driveways shall be subject to approval of the city traffic
engineer under curb cut or laid-down curb permit procedures. Driveways shall not exceed
sixty-five (65) per cent of the property frontage. There shall be a minimum of twenty (20)
feet of curb along the street between driveways where there is more than one driveway on
property under unified ownership or control and used as one premise. The decision of the
city traffic engineer may be appealed to the city council. (Code 1964, § 26-102.3; Ord. No.
8288, § 1, 3-10-81)

If your construction project includes alley access or paving in public right of way please
email or call WPD@fortworthtexas.gov, 817-392-8428, so that the Water Department can
determine if any public water or sewer mains will be paved over. Any identified public
mains that the Water Department determines need to be replaced will be scheduled for
rehab by the Water Dept. before paving activity can commence. This time line varies so it
is critical that the assessment occurs as soon as possible to avoid delaying your project.
Any paving over public water or sewer mains will require a review by the Water
Department to identify conflicts or encroachments. Exhibits must be drawn to scale, show
cross streets, lot boundaries, address and legal description, easements, dimensioning and
profile.

Alley will need to be paved from the farthest property line to the nearest street or existing
alley paving.
