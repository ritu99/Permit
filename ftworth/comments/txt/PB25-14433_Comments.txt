1. 12/8/2025--CORRECTIONS REQUIRED--Section R302.2.2 of the 2021 International Residential
   Code, Common Walls states that no plumbing shall be inside common walls shared by
   townhouses. Your FRC U.L. rating is V340 which is a single Fire Rated Construction wall. Either
   a Double Wall R302.2.1 or a Scab Wall needs to be in place where you can run your VTR's up
   outside the FRC Wall. Please make the necessary changes to the plans and submit the entire
   plan-set as a revision.

   10/17/2025--CORRECTIONS REQUIRED--Table R302.1.1 of the 2021 International Residential
   Code Walls and Projections have to be fire-resistance rated in accordance with ASTM E119,
   UL263 or Section 703.3 of the International Building Code.

   The porch is 3 feet off the property line. The 2021 IRC says that any structure less than 5 feet off
   the property line will have to be Fire-Resistant Construction. There is no call out for the UL design
   of the wall and projection plus the Cedar posts.

   Please revise the plans to reflect the Fire-Resistant Construction type you intend to use and
   submit the entire plan-set as a revision.
