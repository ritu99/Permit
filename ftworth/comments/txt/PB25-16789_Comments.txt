1. 12/5/2025--CORRECTIONS REQUIRED--Please submit the entire plan-set with the cover sheet
   showing all the building codes you are following. Submit this plan as a revision.
2. 12/8/2025--CORRECTIONS REQUIRED--The first page of the Energy Report states that the
   building "meets or exceeds the 2021 IECC. The City of Fort Worth is currently using the 2015
   IECC. Further down in the energy report it does make reference to the 2015 IECC however, the
   Energy Certificate states the wrong Code Year for the Energy Conservation Code. Please correct
   the Certificate and submit it with the entire Energy Compliance Form as a revision.

   2020 NEC". You have redlined it. Thank you. However, that statement needs to be changed to
   reflect the 2023 NEC. Please submit Sheet E-1 with the corrected statement reflecting the 2023
   NEC. Submit this Sheet along with the entire plan-set as a revision. The other redlines can be
   field evaluated.
